## Game A: Crypto Shooter

1. As a part of the hackathon submission, TILE Games platform includes **two original, custom-developed, Oasis-themed, P2E Crypto Games,** both developed using JavaScript. So, within this submission, there are actually **three projects, a GameFi platform and two P2E games.**
2. The major design requirements for the games were to be **playable, bug free, open-source** (so that the team can check for security) and that the games contain standard code snippets that are called to interact with the Oasis network through the TILE Games Platform.
3. The first built-in crypto game is [**Crypto Shooter**](https://github.com/tunahandanis/demo-aim-game), where crypto enthusiasts practice their reflex motor skills by catching crypto coins (+1 point each), but avoiding fiat currencies (-1 point each).

The Gamer can convert Game Points to TILE Tokens on the home page.

### Further Remarks on the Built-in Games

1. This is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, that a **gaming platform** is developed **with ready Oasis-themed games** in it at the moment of submission to a hackathon.
2. **All content** in the games (images, icons, music, sound) are **provably copyright-granted** to one of the team members. Proof documents can be presented upon request.
3. The platform is designed such that other P2E games, especially open-source JavaScript games, can be added to the platform just by adding certain standard code snippets to interact with the platform.
4. New games can be submitted by any creator to the Developer Team and then are uploaded.
5. The platform is composable; in the future, new games can be embedded into the platform through direct uploading of the docker file, zip file or submission of the GitHub repository link and then the approval of the game by the Developer Team.
